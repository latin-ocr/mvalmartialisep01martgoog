Tu lieet observes dextram teneasque sinistram,
Inveniet, mappam qua ratione trahat.
Cervinus gelidum sorbet sic halitus anguem, 5
’ Casuras alte sic rapit Iris aquas.
¹ Nuper eum Myrino peteretur missio laeso,
Subduxit mappas quattuor Hermogenes.
Cretatam praetor oum vellet mittere mappam,
Praetori mappam surpuit Hermogenes. 10
Attulerat mappam nemu, dum furta timentur:
Mantile e mensa surpuit Hermogenes.
Hoe quoque si deerit, medios discingere lectos
Mensarumque pedes non timet Hermogenes.
Quamvis non modioo ualeant spectacula sole, 15
Vela reducuntur, oum venit Hermogenes.
Festinant trepidi substringere carbasa nautae,
Ad portum quotiens paruit Hermogenes.
Linigeri fugiunt calvi sistrataque turba,
Inter adorantes oum stetit Hermogenes. uo
