OF THE POET. xin

freshness and brillianoy ; in lueidness and appropriateness
of expression it is surpassed by none. He is neither heavy
nor turgid, as Silius Italicus, Statius, and Lucan too often
are ς and though he lived and wrote in what is called the
Silver Age of Roman literature, the purity of the Latinity
is as remarkable in Martial as in the letters of the younger
Pliny. No author, perhaps, when onoe understood, is
more likely or more deserving to become a lasting
favourite with those who have a natural teste for wit,
sarcasm, and repartee. The conditione of understanding
Martial are an aoenrate and extensive knowledge of
Roman topography and arohaeology. To the soienee of
these his writings in themselves contributa, as has already
been intimated, as much, perhaps, as all the rest of the
Roman poets taken together.
The death of the poet-or at least the repert of his
Ι death-is bewailed by Pliny in an interesting letter,
Epist. iii. 21. ‘I hear,' he says, ‘of the deoaase of
Valerius Martialis, and am sorry for it. He was a man
of genius, acute and keen, and one who in his writings
showed the greatest amount of wit, gall, and yet fairness'
y (candoris). He quotes in this letter ten verses from book
1 x. 19 (Ep. 522. 12-21), and eonoludes with these re·
1 markable words: ‘What ean be given to a man greater ¹
l than glory, praise, and eternity? Perhaps, however, his
writings will not last for ever. Perhaps they will not:

1 yet he wrote them with the impression that they would?

i How justly Pliny estimated the hopes and the ambition
of our poet, may be seen from Epp. 224. 4, and 389. 5, 6 ;
, 508. 7,(110. What Pliny ealle his sairneae is shown by the
repeated protests whieh the poet makes against the
charge ofillnature, brought by his enemies against his
more satirioal epigrama. ‘Absit a jocorum nostrorum

simplieitate malignus interpres, neo epigrammata mea
