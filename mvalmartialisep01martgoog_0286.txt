Martial warns the thies who stole, or the person who took by missale,
the cloak of Crispinus (Juv. i. 27), given into his charge (probably at the
bathe), to restore it, and takea toga instead, if he wants to escape detection.
The cloak is of such peculiar colour and make, that it must be noticed on
him, when a toga would not be.

Nescit, eui dederit Tyriern Crispinus ebolium,
Dum mutat cultus indu1turque togam.

Quisquis habes, humeris sua munera redde, precamur:
Non hoc Crispinus te, sed abolla rogat.
Non quicunque capit saturatas murice vestes, 5

Si te praeda iuvet foedique insania lucri,
Qua possis melius fallere, sume togam.
