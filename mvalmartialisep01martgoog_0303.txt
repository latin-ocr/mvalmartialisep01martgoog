An exaggerated eompliment to Domitian for his services to the guduin
founding and restoring temples.

Quantum iam superis, Caesar, caeloque dedisti
Si repetas et si creditor esse velis,

Grandis iu aetherio lieet auctio fiat Olympo
Coganturque dei vendere quidquid hubent:

Conturbabit Atlas, et non erit untia tota,
Decidat tecum qua pater ipse deum.

Pro Capitolinis quid enim tibi solvere templis,
Quid pro Tarpeiae frondis honore potest?

Quid pro culminibus geminis matrona Tonantis?

Pallada praetereo: res agit illa tuas. tt l
