412 Μ. VAL. MARTIALIS

Maior Caclius et minor fatigant:
‘Me multcs‘repetita post Decembres
Accepit mea rusticumque fecit¹
Auro Bilbilis et superba ferro.

Hic pigri colimus labore dulci
Boterdum Plateamque; Celtiberis
Haec sunt uomina crassiora terris.
Ingenti fruor improboque somno,
Quem nec tertia saepe rumpit hora,
Et totum mihi nunc repono, quidquid
Ter denos vigilaveram per annos.
Ignota est toga, sed datur petenti
Rupta proxima vestis a cathedra.
Surgentem focus excipit superba
Vicini strue cultus iliceti,

Multa vilica quem coronat olla.
Dispensat pueris rogatque longos
Levis ponere vilicus capillos.

Sic me vivere, sic iuvat perire.
