EPIGRAMMATA.

On the toga presented to the poet by Parthenius (Ep. 407. le).

Haeo est illa meis multum cantata libellis,
Quam meus edidicit lector amatque togam.
Partheniana fuit quondam, memorabile vatis
Munus: in hac ibam conspiciendus eques,
Dum nova, dum nitida fulgebat splendida lana 5
Dumque erat auctoris nomine digna sui3
Nunc anus et tremulo vix accipienda tribuli,
Quam possis niveam dicere iure tuo.
Quid non longa dies, quid non consumitis anui?
Haec toga iam non est Partheniana, mea est. 10

The subject is nearly the same aa Ep. 102, to which the present has a
close resemblance. This (laurus (like Accius Labeo) had compcseds
stupid epis in twelre books on the Trojau war.

Ingenium mihi, Gaura probas sic esse pusillum,
Carmina quod faciam quae brevitate placent.
