146 Μ. VAL. MARTIALIS

Qui legis et tota cantas mea carmina Roma:
Sed nescis, quanti stet mihi talis amor.
Nem si falciferi defendere templa Tonantis i
Sollicitisque velim vendere verba reis,
Plurimus Hispanas mittet mihi nauta metretas
Et fiet vario sordidus aere sinus.
At nunc conviva est comissatorque libellus,
Et tantum gratis pagina nostra placet. Ι
Sed non et veteres contenti laude fuerunt,
cum minimum veti munus Alexis erat.
