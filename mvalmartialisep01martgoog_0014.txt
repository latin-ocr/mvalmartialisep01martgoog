at the cost of his independence⁴. ‘Quid si per quin·
decim annos,’ asks Tacitus⁵, ‘grande mortalis aevi
spatium, multi fortuitis casibus, promptissimus quisque
saevitia principis, interciderunt? Pauci, ut ita dixerim,
non modo aliorum sed etiam nostri srrpcrstites sumus,
exemptis emedia vita tot annis, quibus juvenes ad
senectutem, senes prope ad ipsos exactae aetatis ter·
minos per silentium venimus? Like Tacitus, Martial
lived to sec, and wrote to praise, the happier reigns of
Nerva and Trajan. If Martial was a sensualist‚ he was

a Roman among Romans that lived the samo lives them-
selves, and praised and bought epigrams bearing most
undisguisedly on the fashionahle vices ⁶. But in Martial
we have a great mixture of the bad with the good. If
we have placed the latter in the hands oi the young with·

out the sear of scandal from the former, Ι think that we
shall have served in some degree the cause of Roman'
literature.

It only ramains to add, that we have adopted in this
edition the excellent and carefully rerised text of F. G.
Schneidewin (Teubner, 1853), which, being founded on a
collation of all the best MSS, is as good a one as can ba
obtained, or even desired. In three or four places, per·
hapa, we have venturcd slightly to modify the punctuation.
