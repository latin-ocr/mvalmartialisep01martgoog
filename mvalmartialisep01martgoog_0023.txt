xviii LIFE AND WRITINGS

as ‘theat1·um’).

In writing epigrama Martial did not profess to be the ¹
founder of the style, in the sense that Horace claimed to
have introduced lyric verse into Latium. On the con·
trary, he preferred to follow Catullus, Marsus, and Pedo
Albinovanus:

‘Sit locus et nostris aliqua tibi part'e libellis,
⁸ Qua Pedo, qua Marsus, quaque Catullus crit,'

he says (Ep. 216) in writing to a friend3 of Catullus

especially he often expresses his admiration¹. In some l
sense it may be said, as Dr. Smith observes (Classical l
Dict.), that ‘he first placed the epigram upon the
narrow basis which it now occupies‚ and from his time l

the term has been in a great measure restricted to denote ¹
a short poem, in which all the thoughts and expressions ¹
converge to one sharp point, which forms the termina· 1
tion of the piece? In point of fact, however, many of
the epigrama of Catullus resemble those of Martial both

in their character and their length3 audit is but fair

to regard Catullus as the first Roman epigrammatist.
Martial as clearly and avowedly imitated him as Persius

did Horace. ’

It would be unfair to regard Martial merely as a
composer of lampeons in verse, or esteem him only as a
satirist or a wit, though he oooupies the first place in
both these respects. He was a poet of more than ordi·
nary merit, certainly the first of the age in which he lived.
His style has a singular charm from its ever-varying
