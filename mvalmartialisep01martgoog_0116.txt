ΕΡ. 140. (ΠΙ. xlvi.)

Το Candidus¹(Ep. 87), with an ingenious and satirical excuss for not
tntinuing visits as a client.

Exigis a nobis operam sine fine togatam.
Non eo, libertum sed tibi mitto meum.

“Non est'’ inquis “ idem.'’ Multo plus esse probabo:
Vix ego lecticam subsequar, ille feret.

In turbam incideris, cuneos umbone repellet 3 5
Invalidum est nobis ingenuumque latus.

Quidlibet in causa narraveris, ipse tacebo :
At tibi tergeminum mugiet ille sophos.

Lis erit, ingenti faciet convitia voce :
Esse pudor vetuit fortia verba mihi. 10

“Ergo nihil nobis '’ inquis “praestabis amicus ?”
Quidquid libertus, Candide, non poterit.
