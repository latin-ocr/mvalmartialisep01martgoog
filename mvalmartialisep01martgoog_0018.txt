OF THE POET. xiii

Bytho Emperor Domitian, whom he everywhere flatters
with a servility that sounde to our ears positively ridi-
culous, he was held in high estimation 11111 author3
and he was also patronized by two very influential
members of the emperor'e household, Parthenius and
Burrus. Priscus Terentius, Stella the poet, Faustinus,
Julius Cerealis, Julius Proculus, Julius Martialis, Atedius
Melior ¹, were also among 1111 wealthy patrons3 and from
some 01 these, or perhaps in part from the sale of his
poems, which were very successful, both in Rome and
in all the provinces⁸, he obtained a farm and villa, to
which he often alludes, at Nomentum, on the borders 01
the Sabine territory. A frequent theme in Martial's epi·
grams is the gemes in the amphitheatra, i. e. in the great
Colosseum then recently ereoted; in the collection of
epigrama commonly prefixed to the editions, 11111 known
as ‘Liber Spectaculorum,' or ‘De Spectaculis Libellus’
(though the genuineness of them is rather doubtful),
this 11 exclusively the subject. The information to be
derived from these, both as to the kinds 01 beaets im-
ported to Rome, to be either baited or exhibited, and the
marvellous degree 01 taming to which even 110111 11111
wild bulls were brought, is as curicus as it is copious and
valuable. The emperor, as we know also from Suetonius ⁴,
took the greatest interest in these exhibitione, as wellas
in the gamos in the Circus. To flatter 11111 please him,
Martial would do and say any thing. Among the marks

Ἴ 01 favour he obtained from Domitian were the jus trium
