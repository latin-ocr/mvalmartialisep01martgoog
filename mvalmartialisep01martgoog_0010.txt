TO THE READER. v

the particular epigrams we would admit (aud be it under· .
stood, we have omitted hardly any of the readable sort
which can fairly be considered important, excluding, how-

could be adopted. Ithink thet to have produced a
readable edition of the best parts of such a poet, fit to be
placed in the hands of all, with a brief heading ιο each
epigram to, explain the general drift of it, and with such
notes as will suffice for every purpose of explanation, will
be thought a useful expenditure of labour.
