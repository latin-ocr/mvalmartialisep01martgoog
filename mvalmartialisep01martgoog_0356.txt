The poet sends his book, through the Mune, ιο his friend Plin tho
ounger (who in hie Epistles, lib. iii. 21, cites the lest ten verses ol this
ai ram in an interesting letter· ιο his friend Cornelius Priscus, in which
· aments over the report ol Martial's death).

Nec doctum satis et parum severum,
Sed non rusticulum nimis libellum
Facundo mea Plinio, Thalia,

Altum vincere tramitem Suburae.
Illic Orphea protinus videbis

Udi vertice lubricum theatri,
Mirantesque feras avemque regis,
Raptum quae Phryga pertulit Tonanti.
Illic parva tui domus Pedonis
Caelata est aquilae minore pinna.
Sed ne tempore non tuo disertam
