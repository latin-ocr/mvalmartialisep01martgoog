A Lin anian (Ep. 28. 5), coming home late from a least, fell ana
trained lis ancle. His one lean attendant could not raise hini, and there
e lay, till some slavos came by carrying a corpse on a bier. By him they
‘ere persuaded'p) change their load, and carry his disabled master home,
lro, to all inte ts, was aa dead as the corpse itself. There is a play on
lallus, ‘a Gaul,' and also a ‘eunuch' and in that sense ‘mortuus‘

Dum repetit sera conductos nocte penates
Lingonus a Tecta Flaminiaque recens,
Expulit offenso vitiatum pollice talum
Et iacuit toto corpore fusus humi.
Quid faceret Gallus, quase ratione moveret? 5
Ingenti domino servulus unus erat,
Tam macer, ut minimam posset vix ferre lucernam:
Succurrit misero casus opemque tulit.
Quattuor inscripti portabant vile cadaver,
Accipit infelix qualia mille rogus. 10
Hos comes invalidus summissa voce precatur,
Ut quocunque velint, corpus inane ferant.
Permutatur onus stipataque tollitur alte
Grandis in angusta sarcina sandapila. ,
