OF THE POET xvii

Not much uncertainty exists as to the dates and places
at which the books were written. The first 'nine were
published ot Rome in the course of twelve years, as the
poet himself says ⁰, in the reign of Domitian. The first,
however, seems to have been brought ont after the second
and third 3 for in ii. 93 he says to a friend, ‘You ask where
book i. is, when this is book ii. ;’ and in Ep. 109, in in-
troducing the third book, as written in Gallia Togata,
he speaks of ‘librum priorem,' not as ‘libros priores?
And yet in Epa he addresses his boolr as an author
would who was about to appear first before the public.
Inconsistcntly with this, he commences his first book
with a somewhat boastful vaunt—

‘Hic est quem legis ille, quem requiris,
Toto notus in orbe Martialis
Argutis epigrammaton libellis!

From which it would seem that the first book was either
brought out later, or added to in a subsequent edition.
The tenth book was published in the short period (little
more than a year) during- which Nerva wore the imperial
purple. The eleventh and twelfth appeared during Tra-
jan’s reign, the latter, as the poet distinctly says, ina
letter to Priscus Terentius, prefixed to the book, after an

l interval of three years' idleness, ‘triennis desidia? This
= book was written in Spain. Some of the epigrama in

’ dabat lector, nunc dabit auctor opus.' (Lib. ix. Ep. 84.) Schneidewin
(Praef. p. iii.) says, ‘libri novem priores Domitiano imperante editi
sunt iuter annos lxxxii et xcv post Christum? If so, we must iu·

the ‘Book of Games’ were probably written in the time
of Titus, who had completcd and dedicated the great

⁹ Ep. 492. 9, ‘omne tibi nostrum quod bis trieteride juncta Ante
